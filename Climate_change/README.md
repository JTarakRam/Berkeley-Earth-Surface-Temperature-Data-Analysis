## Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Data Analysis

Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Data provides global land temperature measurements over time, which is a crucial dataset for climate research and analysis.<br>
The data provides information on temperature anomalies, which are deviations from the long-term average temperature for a given location, and can help us understand how temperature patterns have changed over time and across different latitudes<br>
By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into global temperature trends and their potential impact on the planet.<br>
